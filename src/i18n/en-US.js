            text: "In order to improve the government's service level and keep abreast of the demands of the people in time, government portals often provide user opinion collection or comment functions. These opinion collection functions are open to the public and receive a large number of comments every day. Some of these comments are irrelevant. Some topics need to be addressed or resolved by the government. The government needs to identify the types of comments and deal with them in different categories. Due to the limited management manpower of the government, the manual sorting process alone is inefficient, and it is easy to miss events that need to be dealt with in time. The quality of government services is declining. In response to this problem, the content sentiment analysis system of Rank Online Review is based on TextCNN's deep learning text classification technology, which quickly classifies reviews according to content types, and provides multiple warning methods for problems that need to be dealt with in time. By using this system, government agencies can handle the problems reported by the people in a timely manner, which enhances the government agencies’ ability and efficiency in handling affairs, and has a positive effect on improving people’s livelihood.",

            text: "With the continuous progress of society and the rapid development of artificial intelligence, service robots have been gradually applied to provide services for people in various scenarios in life. At present, related products are mostly services for open domain dialogues or other specific field dialogues. Robots are not effective and have poor scalability. How to improve the service level of service robots has become a content of social concern. In order to solve this problem, the Rank multi-round human-machine dialogue engine is based on machine learning methods and has targeted configuration industries. Corpus, such as the corpus of the banking service robot provides a large number of corpus for banking business, and the corpus of the hotel service robot provides corpus of hotel services, etc., which improves the dialogue ability and service quality of service robots, reduces human resources and improves service efficiency in various industries It is of great significance and value.",

            text: "In geological research, analyzing and classifying rock slices through a microscope is a particularly important task. At present, the traditional method of analyzing the slice images of carbonate rock and sandstone samples is manual. Professional researchers Observe and shoot corresponding microscopic images under a polarizing microscope, and identify the structure and composition of the sample with the naked eye. Traditional analysis methods require professionals to interpret, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and training a professional requires a lot of money And time investment, and manual identification is easily affected by subjective factors, which affect the expert’s observation and identification results of rock slice samples. In recent years, the rapid development of digital image processing technology and artificial intelligence technology has used computers to perform professional rock slice images. Recognition and analysis are possible. The analysis of rock slice images is realized through a computer system. The computer system can quickly complete the analysis of a large number of rock slice images, and can detect many details that are invisible to the naked eye, which can assist researchers in preliminary analysis of a large number of images Classification and analysis. And the computer system can form a relatively uniform analysis standard, and can be quickly deployed and replicated, which can solve the problem of fewer professionals in the industry and a long training time. Therefore, a set of rock slice images has been developed Intelligent identification system has very practical value",
