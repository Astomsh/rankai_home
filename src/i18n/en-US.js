            text: "In geological research, analyzing and categorizing rock slices through a microscope is a particularly important task. At present, the traditional method for analyzing thin slice images of carbonate and sandstone samples is to use manual methods and professional researchers. Observe and take corresponding microscopic images under a polarizing microscope, and identify the structure and composition of the sample with the naked eye. Traditional analysis methods require professionals to interpret, time-consuming and labor-intensive, while training a professional requires a lot of money Time and investment, and manual identification is easily affected by subjective factors, which affects the observation and identification results of rock thin samples by experts. In recent years, the rapid development of digital image processing technology and artificial intelligence technology has used computers to conduct professional rock thin image Recognition and analysis become possible. The analysis of rock thin slice images through a computer system enables the computer system to quickly analyze a large number of rock thin slice images, and can detect many details that are invisible to the naked eye, and can assist researchers in preliminary analysis of a large number of images Classification and analysis. And the computer system can form a relatively uniform analysis standard, and can be quickly deployed and replicated, which can solve the problem of fewer professionals in the industry and longer training time. Therefore, a set of rock flake images was developed Intelligent identification system has very practical value.",
